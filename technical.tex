\subsection{Duta}

Duta is an attempt to create a more modern, scalable standard for IRC client communications.  This is a new client protocol designed to replace the standard RFC 1459 protocol while still maintaining compatibility with the older protocol via server links. The general format is identical to the TS6 link protocol. This is unfortunately a requirement because if the fundamental problems in the IRC client protocol.

Clients are expected to know information about:

\begin{itemize}
	\item Channels
	\item Clients
	\item Limited info about servers
\end{itemize}

All clients are identified by a unique identifier. Information about each client is broadcast in a \texttt{CLIENT} line that describes the client to the user. An example of such a \texttt{CLIENT} line is shown below, along with the format of it:

\begin{verbatim}
:<server id> CLIENT <nick> <ident>
  <display host> <uid>
  <account name or *> 
  <* if staff, C if not> <timestamp> 
  :<real name>
\end{verbatim}

or for a more real world example:

\begin{verbatim}
:420 CLIENT Xena xena yolo-swag.com
  420AAAAAB Xena * 1234567890
  :Xena
\end{verbatim}

RFC 1459 \texttt{MODE} will be broken up into 4 separate commands, \texttt{PROP}, \texttt{STATUS}, \texttt{LIST}, and \texttt{UPROP}.

\vspace{0.125in}

\begin{tabular}{| l | l |}
	Verb & Use \\
    \hline
    \texttt{PROP} & Set channel properties \\
    \texttt{STATUS} & Change rank of clients in a channel \\
    \texttt{LIST} & Change channel lists, such as the \\
                  & list of banned users \\
    \texttt{UPROP} & Change user proprerties (analogous to \\
                   & RFC 1459 user modes) \\
\end{tabular}

There are many other benefits to this new protocol; \texttt{account-notify}, \texttt{away-notify}, \texttt{multi-prefix} and other simple IRCv3 client capabilities will be core parts of the protocol and parsing them will be required to avoid fragmentation.

Registering a connection with the IRC daemon is now also a lot less stateful and will require only one command from a client instead of two as RFC 1459 mandates.

If a user gets a private message or notice from a client it doesn't previously knowledge about (services, random messages, etc) it must send a \texttt{CLINFO} line to the server requesting information on the client as identified by its UID.

Because the users are all identified by their UID and the UID is made up of the Server ID plus a unique number (constantly incrementing), a netsplit can be broadcast to clients only in the form of a server ID quitting. This will also save a lot of bandwidth as netsplit quit messages can get costly quick. It would be:

\begin{verbatim}
:420 NETSPLIT 450 :*.net *.split
\end{verbatim}

instead of sending something like this for every client lost in the split:

\begin{verbatim}
:Tekner!user@legendsofequestria.com
  QUIT :*.net *.split
\end{verbatim}

\subsection{Cod}

Cod is an extended services package for IRC networks using TS6 family IRC daemons. It is designed to be very modular, allowing some networks to only enable what they will need, but also to handle some things normally handled by channel bots. This works symbiotically with Elemental-IRCd.

Over the last 5 months of writing this project mostly from scratch (some module code is recycled from other projects or has turned into other projects), I have learned more about program design and modular management. I also learned how to properly use \texttt{select()} and made Cod asynchronous without affecting too many other parts of the core.

\subsection{Elemental-IRCd}

Elemental-IRCd is a fork of the (now defunct) ShadowIRCd project. It is also a fork of Atheme's Charybdis irc daemon with more user-friendly features. Most of these things are security patches, network staff usability features, patches that make centralized management simpler and extra status levels in channels; but the resulting core changes mean it needs to be its own project.

At one point I wrote up something to the Full-Disclosure mailing list about a bug I found in its upstream ShadowIRCd, a temporary fix, and why the bug could cause the entire network to segfault if a malicious user sent a specially crafted SASL authentication session. You can find my writeup on it, including full exploit code and debugging information on the Full-Disclosure archive: http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2014/Mar/320 Since the full-disclosure email was sent, a full patch has been contributed and accepted into the main tree.

\subsection{ircmess}

When writing Cod I wrote a custom IRC line parser. After realizing it would be useful in my other projects, I packaged it up in the cheese shop. You can install it with \texttt{pip install ircmess} or see more information about it here: https://github.com/lyska/ircmess

\section{Testing}

\subsection{Microsoft}

I have worked for a year with Volt doing hardware testing for Microsoft. I am currently under a strict NDA because of this, but I am allowed to tell you it was for the Xbox series of game consoles.
