# ShadowIRCd

My work on ShadowIRCd is the following:

 * Merging patches from upstream charybdis
 * Working with users to identify features to add and adding them
 * Stability testing with real-world setups

Currently (as of the commit of this document), I have an irc server set up on sparkle.niichan.tk in port 6667 (*ssl port 6697*) that is running the git head of the version of ShadowIRCD that I have contributed to.

For a list of features committed in from Charybdis by me, please see [here](https://github.com/shadowircd/shadowircd/commits/master?page=4) and work your way forward from there. There's at least 100 commits.

I have good reason to believe that those commits listed with some stability tweaks here and there, that those commits will make up the release of ShadowIRCD 6.4.
