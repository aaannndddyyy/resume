Hello,

My name is Christine Dodrill and I would like to apply for your open position as a Linux Engineer for your company.  I currently help maintain and administrate an IRC network ranking in NetSplit.de's top 100 list of networks that runs mostly on AWS and internally uses a lot of Amazon tools and workflows.  We currently have near zero downtime and have a lot of monitoring systems in place to notify us within seconds in case of attacks or other rare downtime events.  I am an avid scripter, favoring scripting together existing tools instead of developing monolithic new tools to do a job.

I mostly have been using shell scripting recently, mainly for a tool I am still planning out that would be like Puppet or Chef, but I would do it on my own so I can better understand how tools like that work.  I have written initscripts and deployed custom system services using them. I also am a package maintainer for a few packages in Alpine Linux, namely Tor, ShadowIRCD and ii.

I personally believe that uptime should never be sacrificed for any reason and that services should be written to reflect this.  I am a core developer for the IRC daemon that PonyChat, the network I help out on, uses.  I also believe that if I use a project a lot and I like it, that I should contribute to it in some way as a thanks to the people that make it.

I have done a lot of video encoding and know when and to sacrifice quality for disk space and how to make media stream well without having visual artifacts or other unsightly things. I also know when to pick certain audio/video codecs and containers, as well as making a video file that has generic enough codecs that just about any media player can read it.

Thank you for reading this and considering my application, my resume is attached and can be opened with any standard PDF reader.

Have a good day,

Christine Dodrill
