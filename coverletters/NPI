Hello,

My name is Sam Dodrill and I would like to apply for your job opening as an IT Support Engineer.  I do a lot of IT work on my own time for my personal projects as well as for more professional instances with the IRC network I voulnteer on, PonyChat. 

A big part of an IRC Operator's job is to give support to people that use your chat service. These people can have any level of experience with a computer, and it is important to help them quickly, kindly and reasonably so that they can have the quality chat experience they are looking for.  Sometimes people accidentally get themselves caught on big blacklists such as DNS Blackhole lists. I recently helped develop a tool available on my Github page called rblwatch that does lookups on IP addresses in those blacklists so I can better let users know what the problem is and how to fix it.  It currently scans every DNS blacklist I could find, a total of about 80. This lets you know if they are a Tor exit node, a dynamic IP, an untrusted IP address for email, previously used IP in a drone attack, and many other things. I currently use this tool to help give detailed and easy to understand suggestions and directions to help fix problems as they come up and currently lead the board in speed and detail for helping users.

I have used Windows since I was a small child and feel comfortable doing just about any task on it. I have also taken a CCNA class and understand IP routing for both IPv4 and IPv6. I feel very at home diagnosing network issues and would like to do so at a professional level.

Thank you for considering me for your position, my resume is attached as a PDF file. It should open in any standard PDF reader.

Have a good day, 

Sam Dodrill
